## Dataset Information
What do the instances in this dataset represent?
Instances are patients

Additional Information
The target attribute for classification is Category (blood donors vs. Hepatitis C, including its progress: 'just' Hepatitis C, Fibrosis, Cirrhosis).

Has Missing Values?
Yes 

## Variables

    Category: Patient classification (e.g., Blood Donor, Hepatitis, Fibrosis, Cirrhosis)
    Age: Patient's age in years
    Sex: Patient's gender (m for male, f for female)
    ALB: Albumin, a protein made by the liver
    ALP: Alkaline Phosphatase, an enzyme related to liver and biliary system
    ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase, an enzyme indicating liver damage
    AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase, another enzyme indicating liver damage
    BIL: Bilirubin, a product of red blood cell breakdown
    CHE: Cholinesterase, an enzyme involved in fat processing
    CHOL: Cholesterol, a type of fat in the blood
    CREA: Creatinine, a waste product used to assess kidney function
    GGT: Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase, an enzyme indicative of liver disease
    PROT: Total Protein, measuring overall protein in the blood

    ALB (Albumin): g/L
    ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase): U/L (Units per Liter)
    ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase): U/L (Units per Liter)
    AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase): U/L (Units per Liter)
    BIL (Bilirubin): μmol/L
    CHE (Cholinesterase): U/L (Units per Liter)
    CHOL (Cholesterol): mg/dL or mmol/L
    CREA (Creatinine): mg/dL or μmol/L
    GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase): U/L (Units per Liter)
    PROT (Total Protein): g/dL or g/L
